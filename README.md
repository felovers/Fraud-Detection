# Fraud-Detection
Code for a Fraud Detection algorithm using machine learning.

As of today, the .ipynb file is deprecated, changes will be applied to it on a later date.
Will keep the priority of updating the .py file first.

The comparison file compares between two different models to test how each works and how good they are for the task at hand (Fraud Detection).

Next Updates:
The comparison .py will have a different dataset and an experience of downloading the dataset directly from Kaggle.
