# Fraud-Detection
Code for a Fraud Detection algorithm using machine learning.

The Fraud_Detection.py file is the main file of the branch, as it does everything needed for the application, be it training or testing.

The comparison file compares between two different machine learning models to test how each works and how good they are for the task at hand (Fraud Detection).

The GUI file contains a graphic interface while maintaining the same code that's in the Fraud_Detection.py file for training and detection.

# *Next Updates:*
Updates to the GUI, making it nicer in general.
